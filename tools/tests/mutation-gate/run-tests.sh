# Regression tests for tools/mutation-gate.sh — the loop-facing test-strength gate.

# Proves the proportional contract (the reason the wrapper exists):
#   (a) no files            -> exit 0 (PASS).
#   (b) only non-applicable (.md/.sh) changed -> exit 0 (PASS, nothing to test).
#   (c) applicable source, runner kills all   -> exit 0 (PASS).
#   (d) applicable source, a mutant SURVIVES  -> exit 1 (BLOCK — the only failure).
#   (e) applicable source, runner ABSENT (rc 3) -> exit 0 (degraded, loud warn).
#   (f) mixed languages, one survives          -> exit 1 (survivor dominates).
#   (g) --staged derives files from the index  -> exit 0 with nothing staged.
#
# Deterministic + tool-independent: a STUB mutation_check.sh (injected via
# MUTATION_CHECK_BIN) provides the registry() table AND a scripted exit code, so
# the test never needs a real mutation runner installed.
