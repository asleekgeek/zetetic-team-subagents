# mutation-gate.sh — the LOOP-FACING test-strength gate. Wraps the scoped
# mutation runner (tools/mutation_check.sh) so the autonomous build loop can run
# mutation testing as one of its acceptance gates (memory/acceptance-gates*.yaml)
# without freezing on the cases a raw mutation_check.sh invocation rejects.
#
# Why a wrapper, not a raw mutation_check.sh gate: mutation_check.sh is a precise
# per-language tool (one language per call; Python needs --tests; exits 2/3/4 on
# usage / missing-runner / missing-config). A loop iteration's changed set is
# arbitrary (often .md/.sh only, or mixed languages, on a host without the
# runner). This wrapper makes the gate PROPORTIONAL and SOUND:
#
#   * no mutation-applicable changed source  -> PASS (exit 0): nothing to test.
#   * applicable source, runner+config ready -> run mutation_check.sh per language;
#       a SURVIVING mutant -> FAIL (exit 1): the real test-strength failure.
#   * applicable source, runner/config absent -> GRACEFUL DEGRADATION (exit 0 with
#       a LOUD stderr warning), verbatim per test-engineer Move 8 step 2: do not
#       report a mutation result you did not execute, and do not silently block a
#       tool-less environment. The authoritative external check remains the
#       human/CI re-gate (autonomous-build-loop INV-2). Survivors are the only
#       thing that blocks — absence of a runner is surfaced, not faked either way.
#
# Single source of truth: the language<->extension table is parsed from
# tools/mutation_check.sh registry() — adding a language there extends this gate
# automatically (coding-standards.md §1.2 Open/Closed). This file never restates
# the table.
#
# Python test selection: mutmut needs a test path. Resolved from $MUTATION_GATE_TESTS,
# else the first existing of: tests/ tests_py/ test/. If none resolves, the Python
# group degrades (warn), it does not block.
#
#   usage: mutation-gate.sh <changed-file> [<changed-file> ...]
#          mutation-gate.sh --staged          # files from the git staged diff
#
# Exit codes (deterministic — this is a gate): 0 pass or degraded; 1 surviving
# mutant on changed code. source: §12 (DeMillo–Lipton–Sayward 1978; Jia & Harman
# 2011); test-engineer Move 8; product-safety §12.5 (blocking half = scoped run).
